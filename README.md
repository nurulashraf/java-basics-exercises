## Overview

This repository was created as part of a foundational programming course. It focuses on essential programming principles like data types, control structures, loops, methods, and object-oriented programming concepts. The exercises are designed to build proficiency in Java programming step by step.

---

## Features

- **Hands-On Exercises**: Includes practical exercises to reinforce learning.
- **Organised Structure**: Files are clearly separated into source code and compiled binaries.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Designed for those new to Java programming.
- **Real-World Examples**: Exercises demonstrate concepts through relatable scenarios.
- **Extensible**: Contributions are welcome to expand and improve the content.

---

## Structure

The repository contains two main folders:

- **`src`**: Contains the source code files (`.java`) for all exercises. Editable and viewable in any text editor or IDE.
- **`bin`**: Contains the compiled class files (`.class`). These are the executable versions of the programs.

### Available Exercises

Each folder includes the following exercises:

1. `ArithmeticCalculations`
2. `CelsiusToFahrenheit`
3. `CuboidVolume`
4. `FahrenheitToCelsius`
5. `InchesToCentimeters`
6. `MetersToInches`
7. `RectangleArea`
8. `StringOutput`
9. `UserInputCalculations`

---

## Prerequisites

To work with this repository, ensure the following are set up:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or above.
   - [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
2. **IDE/Text Editor**: Any Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans) or a basic text editor.
3. Basic knowledge of how to compile and run Java programs.

---

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nurulashraf/ur-fop-jav-ex1.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository folder:
   ```bash
   cd ur-fop-jav-ex1
   ```

3. Open the `src` folder in your IDE or text editor to view and edit the source code.

4. To run an exercise, navigate to the `src` folder and compile the desired `.java` file:
   ```bash
   javac ArithmeticCalculations.java
   ```
   Then run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   java ArithmeticCalculations
   ```

5. Use the `bin` folder to directly run the compiled `.class` files if needed.

---

## Questions PDF

The repository also includes a PDF file named `Questions.pdf`, which provides the requirements and descriptions for each exercise. This document serves as a guide to understand what each program is supposed to achieve. Refer to this file to get a clear idea of the objectives and expected outputs for each task.
